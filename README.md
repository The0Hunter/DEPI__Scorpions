### Description project summary ###

### This project integrates a phishing detection model with the Wazuh security platform to enhance email threat detection. The system analyzes email logs, identifies phishing patterns with over 90% accuracy, and sends real-time alerts through the Wazuh dashboard. It was implemented by configuring Wazuh Server and Agent to monitor file, process, and log activity, successfully detecting malicious attachments during testing. The result is an automated, fast, and accurate phishing detection solution that strengthens organizational security.  ####
